This repository contains a collection of autoencoder models implemented in Python. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for dimensionality reduction, denoising, or anomaly detection.

Features :

->Diverse Autoencoder Architectures: Includes various types of autoencoders like simple, variational, denoising, and convolutional autoencoders.

->Modular Codebase: Each model is organized into separate modules for ease of use and modification.

->Customizable: Easily configure the architecture, activation functions, loss functions, and optimization algorithms to suit your needs.

->Support for Multiple Datasets: Pre-configured support for popular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and custom data.

->Visualization Tools: Built-in methods to visualize the performance of the autoencoder, such as reconstructed images and latent space projections.

->Pre-trained Models: Pre-trained models for quick experimentation and deployment.
